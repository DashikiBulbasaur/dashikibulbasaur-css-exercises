<!-- this is finished. I think my css is pretty similar to what is on the solution,
except maybe a bit more precise? It has stuff like justify-content: space-between, which,
from what I can tell, doesn't really do anything; it doesn't have margin: auto for the
.logo, so I don't know how it centers its logo both vertically and horizontally and places
it away from the list elements; and my padding is specifically padding-left: 0 since I
noticed it only really affected the left side of .left-links, while the solution's is
padding: 0. I think if the solution's the correct answer, then mine is fine. -->
