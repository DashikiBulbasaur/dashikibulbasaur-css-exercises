<!-- this is done. my solution was fairly similar to the solution given. After checking, I
just mostly what was written since it was more precise (I didn't do this automatically,
I actually checked everytime). Other than that, mine was fairly close besides the margin on
the text. I also forgot to do a gap between the icon and the container. That was an easy
way to space out the modal children. -->
