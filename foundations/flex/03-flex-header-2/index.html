<!-- this is done. I learned a lot from doing this, because while I thought my solution
was close enough to the desired state of the html page, the provided solution was much
more efficient and stripped down in my opinion. like the correct use of justify-content:
space-between instead of using margin-left/right: auto to set the left and right side,
and I completely forgot about using the gap property. using align-item: center on the
children instead of the parent .header was also something I didn't consider. doing that made
me see that there was a slight difference between them in the placement, and that doing it
on the children instead of in the parent made my page look like the intended solution. just
something to think about in future css and flexbox stuff -->
