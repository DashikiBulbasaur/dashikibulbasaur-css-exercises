<!-- this is done. the solution is a lot more stripped down and probably a lot better
than mine, but i'm gonna stick with what i got since mine makes more sense to me.
basically putting everything in a div, and putting stuff in flex-direction column
when needed and centering when needed. gaps and margins when needed, and setting max-width.
 looks a lot more complicated though, which is a flaw.-->
