<!-- this is done. at first, I did a class for both buttons, and an separate id for each one, as I feel that encapsulates the purpose 
 of each type selector. but the solution did separate classes, and grouped the separate classes together in css when necessary. 
 both work perfectly fine. I sort of prefer my own solution -->
