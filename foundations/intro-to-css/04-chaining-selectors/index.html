<!-- this is done. at first, I did the width and height on the html file in the img void because I thought that made more sense. 
 the solution did the styling on the css file, which also makes equal sense. both are good, maybe the css one is better for organization, 
 but for checking specific images, I think doing it on the html file makes more sense. -->
